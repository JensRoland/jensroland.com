This repo contains the code behind the website [jensroland.com](http://jensroland.com). It uses [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) under the hood, mostly because I wanted to try out Vue 3, so since it's my first Vue 3 experiment, it's not pretty.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production
